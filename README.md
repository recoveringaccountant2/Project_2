# TrailSha.pe

A place to share information on local trail conditions.


## The Problem

Southwest Colorado is a trail runner/hiker's paradise.  A subrange of the Rocky Mountains, the San Juan mountains shoot above the surrounding terrain in dramatic fashion.  Each year, between April and June, the deep snow and ice melt away and some of the most beautiful single-track trails in the lower 48--or the world, in my opinion--become accessible on foot (i.e. without skis, ice axes, or any crazy winter gear).  

During this period when the trails are starting to "melt out", aside from messaging a friend on the off chance they've been up a certain trail recently and can share some recon, there is no way to know the conditions of a trail.  Therefore there is no way to sufficiently plan your adventure.  

Trail maintenance groups and volunteers run into similar issues.  While they can communicate internally if they see trees or a mudslide blocking the trail, there is no dedicated system for them to store and share that information in real time.  Even more, there is no way for them to leverage trail information that the public might have.  

Public Land managers (U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, etc.) likely face the same issue as well.  Each season they face the daunting task of deciding where to deploy their meeger allocation of trail maintenance crews and related resources.  

In short, from trail users to local volunteers to land managers, the public needs a dedicated system to share information on trail conditions.

3. Delete the `.git` file, when you are in the root of the file, you can press `ls` and you should see a `.git` file, then go ahead and run `rm -rf .git`


#### Setup your git repo
1. in the project root `git init`
2. `git add .` to add all the starter code
3. `git commit -m "setup boilerplate"` 
4. go to github and create your github and create a repo (Without a readme or liscense you can add that later!)
5. copy the remote address
6. In your terminal add the remote `git remote add origin yourGithubRepo'sAddressGoesHere`
7. `git pull origin master` If a screen pulls up asking you to do something just press `:q` and then `enter` (thats vim btw :) )
8. `git push origin master`

#### Setup your login

0. Setup your database connection string
1. Then Setup Your User Model, 
2. Follow the steps from the lesson plan to get your Google login credentials for your `.env` file (create the file if you haven't), or you can just copy the ones from earlier if you want to reuse them.
3. Setup the Code in your config passport 
4. Setup your callback routes in your `routes/index`
5. Setup a view and test your login!

#### Make a commit
